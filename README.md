## About the Game

Step into the chilling world of a Unity adventure game as Aron, who takes on a dare to explore an abandoned mansion shrouded in mystery. The atmosphere is unsettling, and the creaks of the floorboards hint at lurking secrets.

As you navigate this eerie mansion, you encounter the ghost of a child seeking your help to break his curse. His sorrow and determination propel you forward, intertwining your fates. Thereâ€™s no turning back; you must delve into the mansionâ€™s dark past and confront supernatural forces.

With each step, the mansion reveals sinister layers, flickering lights, portraits with watching eyes, and twisted echoes of laughter. Itâ€™s time to solve dark riddles and face the guardians of its secrets. Will you guide Aron to free the child and uncover the truth, or succumb to the haunting whispers? The choice is yours.
